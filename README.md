# Battle for Brushwood

Battle for Brushwood is a deckbuilding roguelike with heroes from each of the main fields of art, set in an enchanted forest. Fight interesting enemies, build exciting decks, and explore your hero's passion for art through their unique mechanics.

Battle for Brushwood is a work in progress. For now, its main features include:
- Two species of enemies, each with 3 unique moves chosen randomy each turn
- Two cards for the Writer Hero Class, one for damaging enemies and another for blocking incoming attacks
- A status effect system, with statuses for strength, drowsiness and sleep
- A player class, with the ability to play cards, spend mana, take damage, and more
- A unit class, able to take on a particular species' attributes, display intents, manage statuses and target other units and the player
- Draw, Discard, and Exhaust piles belonging to the player, shuffling intelligently each turn
- An Encounter game loop, allowing the player to face enemies in an indefinite number of turns of combat
